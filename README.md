### CodeAlpha Projects:
During my internship with CodeAlpha, I completed the following projects:

1. **FAQ Chatbot**: Built a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a particular topic or product using NLP techniques and pre-built libraries like SpaCy and FuzzyWuzzy. The chatbot includes a user feedback mechanism to improve its responses over time.
2. **Language Translator**: Developed a language translation tool that can translate text from one language to another using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and leveraging popular translation APIs.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking**: Created a system that can detect and track vehicles in a video stream using the YOLOv8 model for object detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization. The system calculates the speed of each tracked vehicle and classifies them as moving or stationary.
